Here are located a set of examples of how the library could be used.

We show them in three different categories:

- basics: The basics of what can be done with the library
    - Thermodynamic properties
    - Saturation points
    - Phase split (FlashPT and FlashVT)
    - Phase envelopes tracing
    - Implementation of a simple algorithm to calculate pure component
      saturation pressure.
- Advanced: How a more advanced user can take benefit of the library.
- extra: Other set of examples with no particular structure.
