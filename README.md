There are multiple equation of state libraries, like:

- Clapeyron.jl
- FeOs
- phasepy
- teqp
- thermo.py
- thermopack
- (many more)

Here we are presenting another (still in development) library that tackles the
same problem just, in another way. Mostly exploiting readability and
extensiblity of Modern Fortran for scientists to have an easy way to implement
new thermodynamic models.

This is an experimental work in progress and we recommend the before mentioned
libraries if you are intending to use some of this in real work.

## Documentation

The latest API documentation for the `main` branch can be found
